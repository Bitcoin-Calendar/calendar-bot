# Bitcoin Calendar Bot

### Archiving and relaying every Bitcoin milestone 

![bitcal-logo-wide](https://i.nostr.build/Z3h9vApqgLXXgvdH.jpg)

## Overview

The Bitcoin Calendar Bot is a Go-based application that reads events from CSV files and publishes them to Nostr relays. This bot is designed to automate the posting of calendar events, making it easier to share important dates and information about Bitcoin history. The bot currently supports English and Russian versions, with plans of adding more languages.

## Features

- **Event Publishing**: Reads events from CSV files and publishes them to Nostr relays
- **Multi-Language Support**: Currently supports English and Russian, with more languages planned
- **Structured Logging**: JSON format logging with rotation for easy debugging
- **Automated Operation**: Configurable to run as a cron job for daily automation

## Requirements

- Go 1.18 or higher
- Access to Nostr relays
- CSV files formatted with event data
- Private keys for the Nostr accounts

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bitcoin21ideas/nostr-calendar-bot.git
   cd nostr-calendar-bot
   ```

2. Build the application:
   ```bash
   go build -o nostr_bot main.go
   ```

3. Configure your CSV files in the same directory as the executable. The CSV should have this format:
   ```
   "date","title","description"
   "YYYY-MM-DD","Event Title","Event Description |https://link.to/resource"
   ```
> Use the `|` character when wanting to introduce a line break. 

4. Set Up Environment Variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the project directory to store your environment variables. This file should not be committed to version control.
   - Add the following lines to your `.env` file to set your Nostr private keys:
     ```
     NOSTR_PRIVATE_KEY_EN=your_english_private_key_hex_here
     NOSTR_PRIVATE_KEY_RU=your_russian_private_key_hex_here
     ```

> You can use this outside of the bitcoin calendar bot context for posting events from different CSV files at specific times on specific dates.

5. Load Environment Variables:
   - The application uses the `github.com/joho/godotenv` package to load environment variables from the `.env` file. Ensure this package is installed and properly configured in your project.

6. Set up Cron Jobs:
   - Schedule the bot to run at specific times for each language version using cron jobs.

   Example Cron Job Entries:
   - For English events at 12 PM UTC:
     ```bash
     00 12 * * * cd /path/to/nostr-calendar-bot && ./nostr_bot events_en.csv NOSTR_PRIVATE_KEY_EN >> /path/to/nostr_bot_en.log 2>&1
     ```
   - For Russian events at 4 AM UTC:
     ```bash
     00 04 * * * cd /path/to/nostr-calendar-bot && ./nostr_bot events_ru.csv NOSTR_PRIVATE_KEY_RU >> /path/to/nostr_bot_ru.log 2>&1
     ```

## Environment Variables

- NOSTR_PRIVATE_KEY_EN: This environment variable stores your Nostr private key for the English account.
- NOSTR_PRIVATE_KEY_RU: This environment variable stores your Nostr private key for the Russian account.
- **Keep Your `.env` File Secure**: Ensure that your `.env` file is included in your `.gitignore` to prevent it from being committed to your repository.

## Logging

The bot uses structured logging in JSON format, which allows for better parsing and analysis. Logs are rotated using the `lumberjack` package to manage log file sizes. The log files contain information about:

- Event processing status
- Relay connection success/failures
- Publishing attempts and results
- Performance metrics

## Nostr Stack

The bot utilizes the Nostr protocol to publish events to relays. It leverages the `github.com/nbd-wtf/go-nostr` package for interacting with Nostr relays, ensuring seamless integration and communication.

## Roadmap

Our development roadmap is organized by quarters:

### Q2 2025
- Complete English event database population
- Implement monitoring and alerting
- Add Telegram channel integration

### Q3 2025
- Implement hashtag optimization and event categorization
- Develop interactive website for browsing events

### Future Plans
- API development
- Web interface
- Community features
- Educational resources
