# This is an example .env file. Copy this to .env and fill in your actual values.
# Do NOT commit your actual .env file to Git.

# --- API Configuration (Required) ---
BOT_API_ENDPOINT="http://your_api_vps_ip:port/api" # Replace with your API's base URL
BOT_API_KEY="your_secret_api_key"             # Replace with your API key

# --- Nostr Private Keys (Required) ---
# The docker-compose.yml services expect these environment variables to be set.

# Production Keys
NOSTR_PRIVATE_KEY_EN="your_english_specific_private_key_hex"

# Test Keys (for -test services)
NOSTR_PRIVATE_KEY_ENT="your_english_TEST_private_key_hex"

# You can add more keys if you have more bot instances/languages, for example:
# NOSTR_PRIVATE_KEY_ES="your_spanish_specific_private_key_hex"


# --- Logging Configuration (Optional) ---
# These settings can be used to override defaults set in docker-compose.yml for each service.
# For example, test services default to LOG_LEVEL=debug and CONSOLE_LOG=true.

# LOG_DIR: Specifies a directory where log files should be stored.
# In the Docker setup, this is mapped to a host directory (e.g., ./logs or ./logs-test)
# The Dockerfile sets a default /app/logs, which is then mapped by docker-compose.
# You generally do not need to set this variable when using docker-compose,
# unless you change the volume mapping in docker-compose.yml.
# LOG_DIR=/app/logs

# LOG_LEVEL: Set the desired logging level.
# Options: debug, info, warn, error
# Production services default to 'info', test services to 'debug' via docker-compose.yml.
LOG_LEVEL=info

# DEBUG: Alternative to LOG_LEVEL=debug. Set to 'true' for maximum debug output.
# Overrides LOG_LEVEL if set to 'true'.
# Production services default to 'false', test services to 'true' via docker-compose.yml.
# DEBUG=false

# CONSOLE_LOG: Set to 'true' to output logs to the console in addition to the log file.
# Useful for interactive sessions or viewing logs with `docker-compose logs`.
# Production services default to 'false', test services to 'true' via docker-compose.yml.
# CONSOLE_LOG=false
